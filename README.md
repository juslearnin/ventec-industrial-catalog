# Comvent Engineering - Project Ventec 🚀

### 👨‍💻 My First Web Development Internship Project

Welcome! This repository hosts the full-stack application I built during my internship at **Comvent Engineering**. This project was my first deep dive into the MERN stack, designed to modernize how the company showcases its industrial ventilation products.

### 📖 What this project does 

Before this website, if a client wanted to know the specifications of a fan—like how much air it moves or how much pressure it handles—they had to call the sales team or wait for an email with a PDF datasheet.

**I built this application to solve that problem.** 

Here is how it works step-by-step:

1.  **The Visual Catalog:** Clients can visit the site and see a clean, animated grid of all available industrial fans (Inline, Axial, Roof Extractors). It’s designed to look professional and technical, building trust immediately.

2.  **Real-Time "Live" Data:** Instead of me typing the product details into the HTML code (where they would get stuck forever), the website talks to a **Database (MongoDB)**. This means the company can update a price or a spec in the database, and it instantly updates on the website without changing a single line of code.

3.  **Direct Communication:** If a client sees a product they need for a factory project, they don't have to copy an email address. They can fill out the **Contact Form** right on the page. This message travels through the backend and is securely saved in the database for the sales team to review.

### 🛠️ Tech Stack Used (MERN)

I built this using the **MERN Stack** to ensure it is fast, scalable, and modern.

* **MongoDB (The Database):** Stores the complex technical specifications for every fan and holds the messages sent by customers.
* **Express & Node.js (The Backend):** The "Brain" of the operation. It handles security, routes the traffic, and connects the website to the database.
* **React.js (The Frontend):** The "Face" of the website. It creates the smooth animations, the responsive grid layout, and the interactive user interface that clients see.

### 🌟 Key Features
* **Dynamic Data Fetching:** Products are loaded from a live API, not hardcoded.
* **Smart Fallback System:** If the database goes offline, the site automatically switches to "Demo Mode" using mock data so it never looks broken.
* **Responsive Design:** Works perfectly on laptops, tablets, and phones.
* **Secure Contact System:** Enquiry forms connect directly to the backend API.
